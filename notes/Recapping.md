As of Jul 3, 2020

```
Systems I would put on the top of the list are: 

US/JPN Turbo-Duo
M1 Sega CD
Sega Saturn
JVC X'Eye
Power Filter Caps for NES-001/NES101/
Saturn PSU
Dreamcast PSU
[Xbox, as recommended in Analog Frontiers]

Systems that I find are a total waste (now) to recap

Dreamcast
N64 (not PSU)
PS2
PS1
```

# Jailbreak PS3 & Add Custom Firmware

[ps3xploit](http://ps3xploit.com) - [Official Forums](https://www.psx-place.com/forums/PS3Xploit/)

(Dec, 2020) 4.87.1 Hybrid Firmware can be installed on ANY MODEL PS3 over any Official Firmware (OFW) version.  The only thing this modified firmware essentially does is bring back the patched webkit from OFW 4.82 that was an entry point for PS3Xploit.

## HEN - Homebrew Enabler

HEN stands for Homebrew ENabler. it also consists of additional functions relatively close to a CFW., but is limited compared to a CFW, however this is a powerful HEN with some potential for additional features.

**Difference between HAN, HEN and CFW?**

**HAN** - stands for etHANol. It allows you to activate custom signed packages and licenses. This means you will be able to launch custom made PS1/PS2/PSP PKG. You also will be able to launch some PS1/PS2 homebrews (converted as PS3 PKG). HAN can be installed on 4.82 OFW but was patched in OFW 4.83. HFW (hybrid firmware) 4.84 (which consists on 4.84 + some changed files - link to thread) restores HAN capabilities. There is no advantage to stay on OFW 4.82 so updating to HFW 4.84 is recommended.

**HEN** - stands for Homebrew ENabler. It allows you to activate custom signed packages and licenses - just like HAN does - but also PS3 Homebrews is now possible.  HEN requires HFW (hybrid firmware) 4.84 to be installed on your system.

**CFW** - Stands for Custom Firmware. It replaces the actual firmware of your PS3 (usually named OFW) and add several features to your system such as PS3 Backup Support, PS2 ISO Support, PSP ISO Support Game Modding Ability, XMB Modding and of course Homebrew Support with brings many more additional functions.  When installed, it's enabled by default when you launch your PS3. Not all PS3 systems are CFW compatible (see link, factory min firmware version of 3.56 and lower). Most famous/stable CFW are :REBUG CFW., HABIB's brand (StarBug) & FERROX are some of the top flavors.

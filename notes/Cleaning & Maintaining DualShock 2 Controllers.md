# Repairs and Maintenance

DualShock 2 controllers consist of weak plastic housings and membrane-based connectors.  In other words, they're a total pain.  Additionally, DualShock 2 repairs are difficult because many of the internal PCB variants are difficult to track down.  There's numerous revisions controllers too, despite some having the same model numbers.  The folks over at Shmups have gone through some effort to catalog these revisions.

While not specific to DualShock controllers, there's quite a bit of information regarding different variants on this site.

# Cleaning 

[Odd Tinkering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_suVrG2dA5BTjJhNLwthQ) on YouTube has restored a number of DualShock variants.  In these videos, you can see that the PCBs and the connectors differ.  I recommend reviewing both videos in order to see how the parts come away from each other.
